## Motivation 

KlayOracle was built during KlayMaker22 Hackathon

* Klaytn is a growing ecosystem. Hence Limited variety of oracles on Klaytn such as Chainlink(testnet), Witnet

* Actively developed oracles take a long time to be deployed to mainnet e.g Chainlink

* We need to lower the barrier to entry to node creation and data aggregation
