### Interact with Node via Command Line
KlayOracle is bundled with the kloc command, which is used to interact with the KlayOracle node. It currently supports the following commands:

* [Create a Klaytn wallet](https://klayoracle.gitbook.io/klayoracle-documentation/components/kloc-command) for a node, so that it can fulfill oracle requests.
* [Get node information](https://klayoracle.gitbook.io/klayoracle-documentation/components/kloc-command)
* [Run the Node](https://klayoracle.gitbook.io/klayoracle-documentation/components/kloc-command) to start watching for jobs and fulfilling Oracle requests from smart contracts.
