## Oracle Problem

By design, the blockchain is deterministic and therefore does not have an inbuilt ability to fetch data directly from an external source or push data to it.

### Impossible 🙅🏻

- For a smart contract to make a GET request to an external API to get KLAY price.
- Run Poll request to update weather data.
- Send a POST request to call a webhook URL with a transaction response.

### Roubustfullness

To build rich applications on the blockchain smart contracts need to be able to access off-chain data.

**Such as:**

What is the price of KLAY to send a user for $1000 worth of USDT deposited?
Generate a unique random number that can’t be guessed or predetermined.
What is the current price of one ounce of Gold for a derivative smart contract?
What s the weather like in Sydney?

This and many more are Off-chain data needed by smart contracts built for a robust full purpose and not just simply for sending and receiving tokens.
