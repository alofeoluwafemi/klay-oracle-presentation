## KlayOracle vs Chainlink

I know the question you have been itching to ask is how is KlayOracle better than other existing Oracles such as Chainlink.

**Firstly, I’d like to point out that Chainlink is currently only active on the Klaytn Baobab Testnet** and **has not yet been made available on Mainnet, despite being in development since August 2021**. They presently have two price feeds, primarily KLAY/USD and WEMIX/USD, and as you can expect, we also have both on KlayOracle and the Baobab Testnet. By building primarily on Klaytn at the beginning, we can more quickly launch features critically needed by developers on the Klaytn blockchain.

**Secondly, our guiding principle is simplicity**. Right now, anyone **with a little technical know-how can set up a KlayOracle node and adapter more easily than they would Chainlink nodes and jobs**. While this is expected with the simple data feeds we have now, KlayOracle’s simplicity is something we aim to maintain even with the addition of more complex data feeds.

**We believe that by lowering the barrier to setting up nodes, oracles, and adapters, we can onboard many more participants on the network**. An increased number of nodes will help maintain secure and decentralized data on the Klaytn network, as more participants supply data, instead of just a few participants.

**We envision ourselves as a less complex, less expensive alternative to Chainlink** that also achieves genuine decentralization by **enabling users to host more nodes (think x10 - x100 nodes than chainlink runs)**.
